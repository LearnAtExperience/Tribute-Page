        <li class="about-item">
          He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated
          during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Worker's Party (DAP), the
          precursor of the Nazi Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921.
        </li>
        <li class="about-item">
          In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a
          sentence of five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto
          Mein Kampf ("My Struggle").
        </li>
        <li class="about-item">
          After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and
          promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He
          frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy.
        </li>
        <li class="about-item">
          By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority. As
          a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for
          chancellor.
        </li>
        <li class="about-item">
          His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of
          restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of
          ethnic Germans, which gave him significant popular support.
        </li>
        <li class="about-item">
          Hitler sought Lebensraum (lit. 'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive
          foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament
          and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany.
